    <h1> Medusa Heroes Short recap </h1>
    <p> <ul> 
          <li> <b> Achilles </b> : shall overthrow Zeus prophecy, dunked in powerful water but not fully cuz then that would be infant murder </li>
          <li> <b> Medea </b> : Carrie Underwood Before He Cheats type of gal. Basically married and saved Jason's ass too many times and he was thirsty for younger girl. Obviously she's upset. </li>
          <li> <b> Penthesileia </b> : Amazonian lady who accidentally killed her sister when she was younger and therefore now is a leader. She died. </li>
          <li> <b> Jason </b> : Remember the golden fleece? That's this guy. He had a lot of thing to do :/ </li>
          <li> <b> Oedipus </b>: Prophecy that he would kill his father, and have sex with his mom. Plot twist, his parents are step parents because his true parents knew the prophecy and attempted to YEET him and failed. He ended up gouging his eyes after seeing his mom/wife hang herself and also because the land was suffering for the incest. Btw has the sphinx riddle. </li>
          <li> <b> Cadmus </b>: Basically went on a voyage to search for his sister Europa who was sexually snatched by Zeus but he didn't really wanna do it so he kinda did his own shit for a while. Followed a my little pony princess Luna cow and founded Thebes by planting the teeth of a waterdragon, which created dirt people to build Thebes. Killing the dragon meant serving Ares for 8 years. Then he also married Harmonia because of the gods but she brought bad luck EVERYWHERE so they left. He turns into a water dragon. TLDR: find your sister instead of founding cities and angering Ares. </li>
        </ul>
