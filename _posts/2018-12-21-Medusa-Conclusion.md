  <p> <b>Momo:</b> so other than the test vioing us with friggin Helen of Troy (WHY) and Polycrustes (Again why wtf) and forgetting that Scheria was a place it wasn't so bad. Watch us get 60s though. It was fun teaching yalllll  ðŸ’“ <br><br>
 <b> Anj: </b> Hi guys, hope you're enjoying your break finally being here! Jawwad and I are so glad that you all were so excited to attend the meetings and hear us rant and meme about our heroes and such a high turnout to the Medusa! It was a long few weeks and it was a delight to have it all come to this Tuesday when we took the Medusa as a whole club, more or less. Admittedly, the Medusa is challenging; we try and make it both informative and fun without just forcing you all to read the actual myths and tests and versions word for word, <i>(COUGH LIKE THE TEST EXPECTED YOU TO FOR POLYCRUSTES AND HELEN-Momo) </i> so we hope you at least enjoyed the experience overall, and we were glad to have so many of you present with us to start off this school year and end off this calender year. <br><br><br>
 So thank you guys so much, we hope this was worth your while, and we look forward to any mythology-related meetings you want us to explore in the future now that we don't have the Medusa pressure on our hands.ðŸ˜Š	ðŸ’“
