	<h1>Our Mission/Charter</h1>
	<p>The Classics and Linguistics Club is supposed to inform others about the origin of words, 
		<i> etymology </i>, enhance Roman/Greek knowledge, and help prepare for nationwide contests. 
		Most of these contests take course over the spring, such as <em> <i> NACLO, NLE, NLVE, NCEE, and MME </i> </em>. 
		The study of the classics is the study of Ancient Latin and Greek, and their associated areas of study, which include
		Ancient Roman and Greek history and culture and <em>mythology </em>. Etymology and some linguistics also come into play
		when studying the classics. For all students interested in any of these diverse topics, CLC can be a home for them to 
		explore their unique interests. To further enrich the classics experience CLC members can have, and take advantage of 
		the breadth of opportunities and connections to the ancient world NYC offers, the club plans trips to museums and
		historical Romanesque buildings that members participate in. Students from diverse backgrounds of all languages are 
		invited to learn more about the language family tree, question the origins of language, and try their hand at 
		computational linguistics in our introductory lectures, group puzzle discussions, or one of our contests, NACLO. 
		General members are expected to attend the meetings, which occur usually once every two weeks especially when it isnâ€™t 
		contest season. Lectures are recommended, but not required, and there will be various lectures on different topics serving
		as contest preparation, for topics like Roman culture, Greek mythology, and introductory Latin. Members do not need to 
		participate in the contests. It is especially understandable if they are not currently enrolled in Latin, as contest 
		prep will be more intensive and extracurricular for them.
